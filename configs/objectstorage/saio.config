[objectstorage_api]
# Tells CloudCafe to attempt getting information from the swift cluster via
# the /info call.
#use_swift_info=True

# Tests can be tagged with a decorator as follows:
#     @ObjectStorageFixture.required_features('feature1', 'feature2')
# These tagged tests, will only be run if all of the features listed have
# been added to the features key.  If use_swift_info is true, features will
# be pulled from the swift info and added to the features defined here.
# The features are defined by adding them to a whitespace separated list
# as follows:
#     features=foo bar ...
# by defaut, no features are added.
#features=

# In addition to setting the features, you can also exclude features from
# being reported.  If for example you have the following:
#     features=foo bar
#     excluded_features=foo
# This will have the same efect as the following:
#     features=bar
# The advantage of this is if there are features returned from the swift info
# call that you do not want to run regularly.  The following special values
# can also be set:
#   __ALL__  - runs all tests tagged with required_features, regardless of
#              the features listed in the decorator.
#   __NONE__ - runs no tests tagged with required_features, regardless of
#              the features listed in the decorator.
# By default, no excluded features are set.
# excluded_features=

# Static Large Objects
# --------------------
# Set what the smallest size of a non-terminal segment is.
# min_slo_segment_size=1048576

# object_expirer_run_interval - defines the interval that the script which
# removes expiring objects runs.
# object_expirer_run_interval=60
