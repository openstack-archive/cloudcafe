    @summary: An object that represents the the response data of a
        Session Persistence.  This is used with Pools.

    @note: Session persistence is a feature of the load balancing service that
        forces multiple requests, of the same protocol, from clients to be
        directed to the same node.  This is common with many web applications
        that do not inherently share application state between back-end
        servers.

        Two session persistence modes are available, as described:

        HTTP_COOKIE: A session persistence mechanism that inserts an
            HTTP cookie and is used to determine the destination back-end node.
            This is supported for HTTP load balancing only.

        SOURCE_IP: A session persistence mechanism that will keep track of the
            source IP address that is mapped and is able to determine the
            destination back-end node.  This is supported for HTTPS
            pass-through and non-HTTP load balancing only.
